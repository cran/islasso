*	Changes in islasso	*
*                          	*
*********************************

===============
version 1.3.0
===============
* Vignette added to the package 'islasso'
* Some bugs fixed.

===============
version 1.2.3
===============
* Some bugs fixed.

===============
version 1.2.2
===============
* Some bugs fixed.

===============
version 1.2.1
===============
* Some bugs fixed.

===============
version 1.2.0
===============
* New implementation of the estimating algorithm. Now islasso is much stabler and faster. 
* New function: general linear hypotheses for linear combinations of the regression coefficients, including confidence intervals.
* New changes:
- prediction function includes confidence intervals for the fitted values
- step Halving with Armijo's rule has been improved.
- convergence criterion has been improved
* Some bugs fixed.

===============
version 1.1.0
===============
* New implementation of the estimating algorithm. Now islasso is much stabler and faster reducing the number of iterations to reach convergence. 
* New changes:
- step Halving with Armijo's rule has been implemented.
- the algorithm includes the possibility to use the elastic-net approach defining an alpha parameter in the objective function as in glmnet package.
- the summary method includes now the degree of freedom for each covariate, and in addition it is possible to choose between t-test or z-test (only for gaussian family).
- optim.islasso has been renamed as aic.islasso the interval specification is not required now, the new  select the best tuning parameter based on the minimization of the AIC or the BIC.
- the function islasso.control has been renamed as is.control and some control parameters have been modified.
- two trace version has been implemented in the function is.control a compact version (trace=1) and a long version (trace=2).
* Some bugs fixed.
